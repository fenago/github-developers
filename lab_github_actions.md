Quickstart for GitHub Actions
=============================


Introduction
------------
You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions
workflow. In this guide, you\'ll add a workflow that demonstrates some
of the essential features of GitHub Actions.

The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be
automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with
the code in your repository.

Creating your first workflow
----------------------------

1.  Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository on GitHub
    if this directory does not already exist.

2.  In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named
    `github-actions-demo.yml`.

3.  Copy the following YAML contents into the `github-actions-demo.yml`
    file:

    
    YAML
        name: GitHub Actions Demo
        run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
        on: [push]
        jobs:
          Explore-GitHub-Actions:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
              - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
              - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
              - name: Check out repository code
                uses: actions/checkout@v3
              - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
              - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
              - name: List files in the repository
                run: |
                  ls ${{ github.workspace }}
              - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
    

4.  Scroll to the bottom of the page and select **Create a new branch
    for this commit and start a pull request**. Then, to create a pull
    request, click **Propose new file**.

Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the
`push` event and runs your workflow.

Viewing your workflow results
-----------------------------

1.  On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2.  Under your repository name, click **Actions**. [![Actions tab in the
    main repository
    navigation](./images/actions-tab.png)]

3.  In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.

    sidebar](./images/actions-quickstart-workflow-sidebar.png)]

4.  From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want
    to see.

5.  Under **Jobs** , click the **Explore-GitHub-Actions** job.

6.  The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of
    the steps to view its details.

    For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:

The example workflow you just added is triggered each time code is
pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the
contents of your repository.
